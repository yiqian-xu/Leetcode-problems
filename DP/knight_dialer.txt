This time, we place our chess knight on any numbered key of a phone pad (indicated above), and the knight makes N-1 hops.  Each hop must be from one key to another numbered key.

Each time it lands on a key (including the initial placement of the knight), it presses the number of that key, pressing N digits total.

How many distinct numbers can you dial in this manner?

Since the answer may be large, output the answer modulo 10^9 + 7.
